# ATP-Tennis-Match-Outcome-Prediction-Model
This repository will develop a predictive model for ATP tennis match outcomes using XGBoost and Python. Advanced feature engineering and modeling techniques will be used to predict match results and identify key performance factors. Data will be sourced from Kaggle, and model performance will be evaluated for real-world effectiveness.
